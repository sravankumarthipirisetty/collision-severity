# collision-severity
Problem statement: Accidents in traffic lead to associated fatalities and economic losses every year worldwide and thus is an area of primary concern to Society from loss prevention point of view.
Modelling accident severity prediction and improving the model are critical to the effective performance of road traffic systems for improved safety. 
In accident severity modelling, the input vectors are the characteristics of the accident, such as driver behaviour and attributes of vehicle, highway and environment characteristics
while the output vector is the corresponding class of accident severity.and create rules on top of it.
